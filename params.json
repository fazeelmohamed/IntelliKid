{"name":"Intellikid","tagline":"2016  SLIIT Software Engineering WeekEnd batch group 011","body":"This is a very simple guideline for everyone to follow while coding. IntelliKid was developed using PHP laravel framework. Framework itself is strictly following MVC(Model View Controller) architecture. So, all developers should adhere to that pattern. Though the entire project follows a common pattern, we still make sure to maintain a good quality and maintainability of the project. Therefore we came up with some basic and useful standards that needs to be followed in when you do coding.\r\n\r\n##Variables\r\n* Variable names should be in all lower case letters. \r\n* Variable names should use '_' as the word separator.\r\n* Global variables should be prepended with a 'g'.\r\n* Global constants should be all caps with '_' separators.\r\n* Static variables may be prepended with 's'.\r\n\r\n##Functions\r\n* Method (function) names should be written in camelcase.\r\n* Method names should be started with a lowercase letter.\r\n* Function declarations follow the \"[BSD/Allman style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style)\".\r\n\r\nNotice the placement of curly braces.\r\n<pre>\r\nfunction fooFunction($arg1, $arg2 = '') {\r\n   if (condition) {\r\n      statement;\r\n   }\r\n   return $val;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n* Functions should be called with no spaces between the function name, the opening parenthesis, and the first parameter; spaces between commas and each parameter, and no space between the last parameter, the closing parenthesis, and the semicolon. Here's an example\r\n\r\n`$var = foo($bar, $baz, $quux);`\r\n\r\n##Comments\r\n* C style comments (/* \\*/) and standard C++ comments (//) are both fine. **Use of Perl/shell style comments (#) is discouraged**.\r\n\r\n##One Statement Per Line\r\n* Avoid using multiple statements in a single line. It might need extra effort to reader to break down the statements.\r\n##Alignment of Declaration Blocks\r\n* Block of declarations should be aligned.\r\n","google":"UA-000000-01","note":"Don't delete this file!
